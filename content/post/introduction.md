Hi everyone! 

After several attempts, I finally step into the world of blogging. Part of my motivation this time, lies in me getting selected for Google Summer of Code 2017 (More on this in a later post). A bit of an introduction about me:

I am Sebastin Santy and I'm a second year undergraduate student pursing a major in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at [BITS Pilani K.K. Birla Goa Campus](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/Goa/). I am an open source enthusiast and an avid programmer. You can find more about me @ [http://sebastinsanty.com](http://sebastinsanty.com).

As the title of my blog suggests, I intend to write more about my thoughts and endeavours on code and expect to update every week, on problems I tackle in this small little world of my coding.

Signing off. Until next time :-).
